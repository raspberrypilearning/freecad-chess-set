The sphere needs to be placed on top of the cube base.
Change the position of the sphere so that it has an `x` of `7.5mm`, a `y` of `7.5mm` and a `z` of `21.5mm`. Then change the `radius` of the sphere so that it is also `7.5mm`

You can change these properties by clicking on the sphere in the **Model** tab and editing their values in the **Property** tab

Here is what the properties of the sphere should look like.
