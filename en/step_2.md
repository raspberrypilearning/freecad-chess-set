## Pawns and Rooks

The easiest pieces to create for your Bauhaus chess set are the pawns and the rooks. This is because they are just simple cubes.

--- task ---
The default size of cube is 10mm x 10mm x 10mm, which is fine for the pawns. Same your file as `pawn.FCStd`.
--- /task ---

--- task ---
Now save the file again, this time calling it `rook.FCStd`. With the cube selected in the **Model** tab of the **Combo View** change the size properties so that it is 15mm x 15mm x 15mm. This is your finished rook, so you can save the file and then close the project.
